IMPORTING LIBRARIES:

        Importing The libraries are numpy, pandas, matplotlib, LabelEncoder
        StandardScaler, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomforestClassier

UPLOADING FILE:

         Uploading the csv file using pandas library and read the csv file

         To check the Shape, info and description of the given datasets

PERFORMING EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS:

          To check the null values of given datasets using isna().sum()

          drop the null values using dropna

          To check the duplicate values of given datasets using duplicated()

          To calculate the correlation of given datasets and plot it using heatmap

ENCODE THE CATEGORICAL COLUNMS:

          To encoding the categorical colunms using the Label Encoding and fit the encode

MODEL FITTING:

          To create models are Random forest classifier , Decison tree classifier
          and Logistic regression classifier

CONCLUSION:

          By comparing different machine learning models based on r2 score
          it is found that Random Forest Model works best for this dataset.
